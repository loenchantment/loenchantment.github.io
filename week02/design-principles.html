            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p class="title">Wisconsin Maritime Museum</p>
            <img src="../images/maritime_museum.JPG" alt="image of museum home page">
            <p>Hick's law concerns minimizing choices on the landing page to increase user engagement. Here the maritime museum has placed a captivasting photo of the launching of a submarine
                with the text "Dive In". This captivates attention and invites the user to continue to explore the site. </p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p class="title">Manitowoc Public Library</p>
            <img src="../images/manty_library.JPG" alt="image of library home page">
            <p>Repetition in design is a vital way to add cohesiveness to a design. The Manitowoc Library repeats the yellow beam of light 
                from the logo in the icons further down the page, drawing the user to explore the links to important content.</p>

            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <p class="title">Renard's Artisenal Cheeses</p>
            <img src="../images/renards.JPG" alt="image of Renard's home page">
            <p>White space increases the readability of websites. In this example, Renard's uses white space to provide padding around
                the log in button as well as the search bar and heading. This makes the associated text much easier to read than 
                if it was crammed up against the borders of the box.</p>
