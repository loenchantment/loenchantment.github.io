                <h3>Bountiful Foods: Our Story</h3>
                <p>Jayne Forsythe's dream, to provide fresh produce to the Carlsbad, CA area began in her youth.. As a child, 
                   she had worked on her paren's small farm, pruning fruit trees and weeding the berry patch. Watching them grow
                  and flourish and then enjoying the fruits of her labors sparked a desire to share this with others.</p>

                </picture>
                <p>After graduating with a degree in Business in 1994, she opened Bountiful Foods. The original store and delivery truck
                   soon were unable to keep up with demand, so Jayne found a the current location in 2005. She began offering online ordering
                   and expanded the delivery area. Now you can place an order for delivery from anywhere in the So Cal area. </p>

                <h2>So Cal Spotlight: Alt Karlsbad, Carlsbad Mineral Spa </h2>
                <p>Carlsbad is the home base for Bountiful Foods but it's so much more. Founded in the 
                  early 1800's, it was a whistlestop for the railroad. A mineral spring was discovered by John A. Frazier 
                  that provided water to weary travelers. You can visit it today soak in luxury at
                  Alt Karlsbad Mineral Spa.

                </picture>

                <p>Water from this famous well was tested and found to contain similar chemicals
                  as renowned spas in Karlsbad (originally of Bohemia now the Czech Republic).
                  Carlsbad was named after this famous European city.</p>
